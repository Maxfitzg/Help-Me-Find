        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to our Lost Objects platform! We are a group of passionate students dedicated to helping 
            people recover their lost belongings. Our mission is to create a supportive community where every 
            lost item has a chance to find its way back to its owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe in the power of collaboration and that every small effort counts. We have developed 
            this platform to connect people who have lost something with those who can help them retrieve it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our website is simple, intuitive, and designed to make the process of posting and finding lost 
            objects as easy as possible. We hope this tool will be valuable to our community.
